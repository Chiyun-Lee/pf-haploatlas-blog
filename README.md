- Introduction:
    - **Why** did you build your app? In other words, (1) **why** is your solution better than whatâ€™s already out there, (2) **what** technology tools or processes does it use, and (3) **who** is your target audience (beginners, advanced, intermediate users) thatâ€™d want to read your post?
    - **How** will your app make things faster, cheaper, easier, or better overall? In other words, **what** about your app, your app-building experience, or process is unique and worth sharing?
- Considerations as you write:
    - **How** might someone discover this app in their day-to-day? For example, what keywords would trigger a search result?
    - How will this content best reflect Streamlitâ€™s unique values? (e.g. ease of use, speed to deploy, minimalist code, creative ways to interact with data)
    - What additional content types (if any) do we need to improve discoverability (e.g. Youtube video), or visuals (e.g. pngs or .gifs) that could help paint a clearer tutorial for the user?

# Building tools for genomics researchers to use for tackling malaria

## Using Streamlit for science: open-source tools and open-access data

Many of us are fortunate enough to not hear much about malaria in our day-to-day lives, but the disease actually kills around 600,000 people every year! I work at an academic research institute where I use data science to help researchers around the world understand how different strains of malaria are emerging and disappearing, in order to improve global health strategies against the disease and hopefully make this scarily big number smaller and smaller every year. 

Do you remember hearing about all the different strains of the COVID virus? Omicron, delta, alpha... These strange names were assigned by working out the genetic sequence of the virus from loads of different people who caught the disease, then using algorithms to work out the ancestral relationship between them. When they found a group of viruses which all "looked" very similar, they designated them the same strain. Our institute actually did most of this "working out of the genetic sequence" of the COVID virus for the UK! Now we built a Streamlit app that does something similar for malaria, called the Pf-HaploAtlas, and it's being used by researchers all around the world today! 

Read on to learn:
- What the Pf-HaploAtlas is
- Why Streamlit is so powerful for science
- How you can build apps for science
